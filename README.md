Sorry for my English

One image/video gallery for integrate in Hass like a panel

It is a panel with one or several image galleries.

These galleries are paginated, in principle up to 8 pages

The image and video data are obtained from a folder inside /.homeassitant/www folder.

Through a ".json" file the details of the image and the video are specified.

Using two .sh scripts that are provided it is possible to add and remove images from the .json file

I use the gallery to show the latest images and videos associated with movements in the motion application , when motion is detect I move image and the video file with best movement to galery and insert one line to .json file.
